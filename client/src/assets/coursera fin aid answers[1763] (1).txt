How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

From the part of the world from which I come,education sector is not so good. Deep and thorough learning is very difficult to get.This course will provide me an opportunity to compete with those who come from a society who can afford to take good course.This course is very important to me and it will lay an important and strong foundation to my works ,which i intend to do in this field.This course is actually a ray of hope for me.My career can be greatly affected by this course in both positive and negative ways,which will depend on whether i will be granted Financial Aid for this course or not. My current financial status is not very good and cannot come to avail the offline courses by such reputed Institutions/Universities,which leave me no other option than this online course. The level of education provided by the highly intellectual faculties of this course is surely no match to the best education i can get in my region. Please grant me Financial Aid for this course.

Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

The main reason why i am applying for Financial Aid is because after meeting the basic necessities for making living possible,my father (the only earning member in my family) have to work really hard to make the both ends meet.Also I being a student and a non earning member in my family does not help the case.But my father is very ambitious for me,as i always scored high in my previous examinations,he sees that i should study rather than working because it can be the only way to improve our lifestyle and earning more respect in our society.If i am approved for this Financial Aid ,it would prove a very important and integral part of  my career building.Our current financial status is a  big reason for us to worry but if knowledge,which is a essential tool for the upliftment of our financial status,is granted to me,I can make sure that we can live a life we dream of living.If i will be approved for this Aid ,I will consider myself very fortunate and will always be in debt of Coursera and will be very very thankful to it.

If you answered no, please help us understand why

As mentioned above that I am a non - earning member of my family,it would be extremely difficult for me to repay the loan even if the low - interest rates are applicable.
